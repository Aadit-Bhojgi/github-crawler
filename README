This project contains a simple python crawler. Right now I will keep things simple and build a crawler that will visit all the links on a page upto a certain depth. Maybe things can be extended later.

To crawl a particular url, you need to give that as a command line argument
for example to crawl mycareerstack.com give run the python script as
python crawler.py http://mycareerstack.com
